# Day 1 Completion Report: TrendTracker AI

## 1. Project Overview

The initial version of the **TrendTracker AI** application was successfully set up and deployed. This application is a Next.js-based tool designed to help brand and social media managers track trends by aggregating and analyzing posts from various online influencers. The core technology stack includes Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN for UI components, and Genkit for AI functionalities.

## 2. Key Features Completed

The following key features were implemented and are fully functional as of the end of Day 1:

*   **Influencer Management**: Users can add and remove influencers to track. The UI provides a simple interface for managing a list of influencer handles.
*   **Platform Filtering**: Users can filter aggregated posts based on the social media platform (e.g., YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn).
*   **Dynamic Post Feed**: The main dashboard displays a real-time feed of posts from the tracked influencers, which updates according to the selected filters.
*   **AI-Powered Summarization**: A core feature allowing users to generate an AI-powered summary of all the currently displayed posts. This helps in quickly identifying key trends and topics.
*   **Responsive UI**: The application is fully responsive and provides a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices, with a collapsible sidebar for navigation.

        end
    end

    subgraph "Backend (Server Actions & AI)"
        F --> G[Call generateSummaryAction];
        G --> H["summarizeAggregatedContent (Genkit Flow)"];
        H --> I["Gemini LLM"];
        I --> J{Summary Response};
        J --> K[Return Summary to Client];
    end

    subgraph "UI Update"
       K --> L[Display AI-Generated Summary];
    end

    C_Add & C_Remove & D --> B;
```

## 4. Next Steps

With the foundational features in place, future development will focus on:
*   Expanding the number of supported social media platforms.
*   Adding more sophisticated analytics and data visualization.
*   Implementing user authentication and data persistence.
