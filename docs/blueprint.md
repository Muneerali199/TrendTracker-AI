- Use clean and modern icons to represent data types and social media platforms. Use a consistent style throughout the interface.
- Design a clear and structured layout to display the summarized content and trends. Utilize a card-based design for easy scanning.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience, such as loading indicators or smooth scrolling.
